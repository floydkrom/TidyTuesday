# TidyTuesday challenge code and plots

### A weekly data project in R from the R4DS online learning community

https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday

The #tidytuesday project is a weekly data project aimed at the `R` ecosystem. An emphasis will be placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `dplyr`, and other tools in the `tidyverse` ecosystem.

## Contents 
#### My analyses and visualization of the datasets are organized by week. Each folder contains an Rscript and a png image.
